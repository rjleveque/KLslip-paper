Python code to accompany the paper

- Generating Random Earthquake Events for Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Assessment
  by R. J. LeVeque, K. Waagan, F. I. Gonz ÃÅalez, D. Rim, and G. Lin

The scripts `KL1d_figures.py` and `KL2d_figures.py` produce the figures that
appear in the paper. 

To run these, the following dependencies are needed:

- Python 2.x with the packages:
  Numpy, Scipy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn

- Clawpack version 5.3.1, see http://www.clawpack.org

Note: The seed is set for the random number generator in order to reproduce
the figures exactly.  Changing the seed will produce different realizations
and may change the plots.
